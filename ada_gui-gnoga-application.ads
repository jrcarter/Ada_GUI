-- Changed by J. Carter 2021 to only run "singleton" applications
--                      2025 Removed Port from Initialize

with Ada_GUI.Gnoga.Gui.Window;

package Ada_GUI.Gnoga.Application is
   procedure Initialize
     (Main_Window : in out Gnoga.Gui.Window.Window_Type'Class;
      Title       : in     String := "Ada-GUI Application";
      Icon        : in     String := "favicon.ico");
   -- Initializes the application with a free port
   -- If the default browser is not running, starts it
   -- Opens a new "window" (may be a browser tab) for the application
   -- Title is the title of the "window" and Icon its icon
   -- Applications with different IDs can run at the same time
   -- If multiple applications have the same ID, only one can run at a time
   --
   -- (To Be Honest: the ID is actually the port used to talk to the browser,
   --  and the restriction is because only one program can talk on a port at
   --  a time)

   function Favicon return String;
   --  Returns the name of the Icon passed to Initialize

   procedure End_Application;
   -- Terminate application.
end Ada_GUI.Gnoga.Application;
